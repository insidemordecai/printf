# Making printf in C from scratch

The function should functin the same as the standard `printf` function

## Testing 

The `test/` directory contains our test file which is `main.c` 

To test, run the `autocompile.sh` script as follows:

```
./autocompile.sh
```

The script includes all the flags needed for `gcc` as well as pointing to the location of the test file. The output will be saved to the `root` directory where you can run it as follows:

```
./customPrintf
```
